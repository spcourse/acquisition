# Pandas

This exercise relies heavily on Pandas. All the data that you will scrape you will be stored and manipulated using Pandas. This will require some concepts that you haven't seen before. You will need to improve your Pandas skills further.

## Download assignment

Download the Jupyter notebook assignment here: [pandas.zip](../code/pandas.zip)
(right-click and save).

Unpack the zip file into an appropriate directory.

The zip contains two notebooks: pandas1.ipynb and pandas2.ipynb. **For this module you only have to make pandas2.ipynb**

The pandas1.ibynb is just repetition of what you already know. You don't have to make this one. (But you can of course have another look at it if you feel you can use the exercise.)
